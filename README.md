We have recreated the classic Minesweeper game with all the functionalities in the CLI

This github repo contains all the files required to run the game in the terminal.



~The file board.py contains all the functions required to create a board, print the board and to place mines randomly.

~game_logic.py contains the core recursive function to help reveal the cells along with other important function required to flag a cell and check if the game is over or not.

~file_manager.py stores the best time taken to solve the game and displays it.

~game_state.py stores the state of the game if the user leaves the game in between and displays it the next time the program is run.

~main.py utilizes all the above modules and their functions to run the game smoothly and also maintains a while loop to take user input continuously.


INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE GAME:

  ~Save all the files in the same directory
  
  ~Right click inside the directory and click 'Open in Terminal'
  
  ~Type python main.py


ENJOY !!!
